# üß© Datapull ‚Äì ETL Workflow for B2B Lead Intelligence

This repository contains the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflow component of **Datapull**, a large-scale, production-grade B2B lead intelligence platform managing over **3 million+ lead records**.

This ETL system is a critical foundation for orchestrating real-time lead generation, multi-step validation (email, phone), and B2B data enrichment from external APIs.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The complete **Datapull** platform was built over 1.5 years and integrates tools like **Talend**, **Django**, **Streamlit**, and **SQL (OVH)**. This repository focuses specifically on the **ETL workflow**, which is responsible for:

- Extracting raw B2B lead data from diverse sources (e.g., APIs, CSV, databases)
- Cleaning and transforming the data (deduplication, normalization)
- Validating email addresses and phone numbers
- Loading structured data into a PostgreSQL database
- Triggering real-time updates to the frontend dashboards

## ‚öôÔ∏è ETL Pipeline Stages

### 1. **Extract**

- Pull data from:
  - API sources (company registries, enrichment tools)
  - Uploaded CSV files
  - SQL-based lead pools
- Scheduled or event-driven jobs via **Talend** or Python scripts

### 2. **Transform**

- Clean and normalize company and contact data
- Standardize phone numbers (international format)
- Deduplicate entries using fuzzy matching
- Split full names into first/last names

### 3. **Validate**

- Email verification via 3rd-party API (e.g., NeverBounce or Hunter.io)
- Phone number validation using regex or API
- Flag invalid records and route them to a separate error log

### 4. **Load**

- Insert transformed and verified records into the **PostgreSQL database (OVH)**
- Track insert/update timestamps for auditability
- Trigger alerts or dashboards when batch is complete
